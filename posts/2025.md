# 🧭 The Algorithm, the Awareness Economy, and the Timeline We All Forgot

If you’re reading this — @followers — you’ve already passed through a dozen invisible filters.  

For well over a decade, our social feeds have quietly evolved from digital diaries into instruments of management and prediction. The same behavioral tools that once powered **Cambridge Analytica’s psychographic targeting** now drive every timeline on the planet.  

The result? Even if you have a thousand friends, only a few dozen will ever see the odd post... buried in ads.

The numbers don’t lie. My own dashboard shows it clearly:  
- **3003 followers**  
- **Average reach:** 12–20 people  
- **“High-performing” posts** — thoughtful essays, long reflections, cats — top out around ~300 views  

This isn’t *shadow-banning*… it’s **shadow-curation** — a mechanism designed to keep us engaged and enraged, not informed.  

The consequences spill far beyond social media. As the data pipelines feeding these algorithms grew, their logic migrated — from your newsfeed to your ballot.  

Since **2013**, when Cambridge Analytica was founded under the SCL Group umbrella with Steve Bannon shaping its ideological mission ([t̶i̶m̸e̴l̴i̸n̷e̴](https://davidlones.github.io/index.html#2013)), social platforms have steadily become instruments of persuasion.  
In **2014**, data siphoned through the harmless-looking quiz *“This Is Your Digital Life”* ([timeline](#2014)).  
By **2016**, psychographic micro-targeting was deployed to influence elections ([t̵̰͒͘ḯ̸̼͜m̵͕̑é̵͎l̷͎͝i̵̱̞͐n̵͕̅ȅ̶̛̙̠](#2016)).  

After the firm collapsed in **2018**, the tactics didn’t die — they mutated ([t̶̊ͅǐ̶̧m̵͎͑e̶͔̎l̸͕̆i̷͇̔n̴͈̽e̸͈̍](#2018)).  
“Stop the Steal” narratives went viral in **2020** ([](#2020)).  
Data warfare turned kinetic on **January 6th, 2021** ([ț̵̹͚̉̓ï̴̢͕m̶̳̲̓͜e̸͓͚̎ͅl̶̖̻͕̃̓̒i̷̛̙̝͗ń̷̺̗͋͘e̸̟͍̒̏̔](https://davidlones.github.io/index.html#2021)).  
Now the **Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025** consolidates dozens of organizations to shape future administrations — a capture blueprint echoing Bannon’s promise to *“deconstruct the administrative state”* ([t̸i̶m̵e̶l̸i̶n̶e̴](https://davidlones.github.io/index.html#2025)).  

All of that history is invisible on your feed. So when you ask why so few people talk about it, the answer is simple: they don’t see it. The system never shows them.  

Creators see what the public can’t — the metrics under the hood, the reach graphs, the invisible thresholds of engagement. We post, watch numbers tick upward like heart monitors, and realize how much of the conversation is missing.  

**Engagement has become governance.**  
**Silence is an algorithmic decision.**

If this post finds you, comment. React. Say something — not for metrics, but to prove this feed still has a pulse.  

Because the ghosts of Cambridge Analytica whisper through every timeline,  
and the architects of Project 2025 are still taking notes.
