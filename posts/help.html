    <p class="subhead">
      Our home is facing nearly <span class="highlight">$50,000</span> in property tax debt,
      years of deferred repairs, and the aftermath of medical and financial crises.
      I’ve reached the point where I cannot fix this alone.

      <h2>Our Home & Our Reality</h2>
      <p>
        My name is David, and I live with my family on a five-acre property in Weatherford, Texas.
        This is the first place that ever truly felt like a long-term home for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The house was purchased in 2009 for around <span class="highlight">$300,000</span>.
        Today, county appraisals have pushed its value to around <span class="highlight">$1,000,000</span>.
        On paper, that looks like a success story. In reality, it has become a crushing tax burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since around 2019, I have been the one covering the property taxes. Every bit of savings,
        every bit of available credit, went toward keeping this home out of foreclosure while also
        helping my mother through serious health issues. There wasn’t anything “extra” left for repairs,
        organization, or the thousand little problems that slowly turn a home into a crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to shoulder it quietly. Now I’m asking for help.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Where Things Stand Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Back taxes and penalties together are approaching <span class="highlight">$50,000</span>.</li>
        <li>The house needs professional de-hoarding, deep cleaning, and hauling services.</li>
        <li>Doors and windows need re-sealing and insulation to keep utilities and damage under control.</li>
        <li>Plumbing issues have begun to surface after years of delayed maintenance.</li>
        <li>Caregiving, job loss, and medical emergencies have drained what little margin we had.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tagline">
        This isn’t about cosmetic updates. It’s about stabilizing a home before the foundation of our lives disappears out from under us.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
      <p>
        For years, rising Texas appraisals quietly turned our property tax bill into something
        closer to a second mortgage. When my mother’s health declined and medical and caregiving
        demands increased, I did what many families do: I patched things month to month and hoped
        that next year would be easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2023, I had effectively emptied my savings and maxed out what I could reasonably use in
        credit just trying to keep taxes current. Repairs around the house slowed, then stopped.
        In a decade, rooms became overfilled with belongings no one had the bandwidth to sort. Every outbreak, every storm,
        every leak, every broken fixture pushed more and more onto a list for “after that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, I quietly started a GoFundMe asking for <span class="highlight">$10,000</span>.
        At the time, that felt like the most I could justify asking for. That campaign eventually
        disappeared after inactivity — and the situation has only grown more urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at everything honestly now, the real need is much larger than I was willing to admit then.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What Needs to Happen</h2>
      <p>Here is a realistic picture of what we are trying to raise funds for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Back Property Taxes:</strong> bring the account current and stop the risk of losing the home.</li>
        <li><strong>De-hoarding & Cleanup:</strong> professional teams to clear, sort, and haul away accumulated items safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Repairs:</strong> doors, windows, insulation, and areas where weather and time have taken a toll.</li>
        <li><strong>Plumbing & Safety:</strong> addressing leaks, clogs, and issues that could become serious if ignored.</li>
        <li><strong>Stability Cushion:</strong> a small margin so that one unexpected bill doesn’t undo all the progress.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tagline">
        In total, this is an <span class="highlight">$80,000–$100,000</span> scale problem.
        I know most people can’t fix that alone — but many people together can.

    <h2>How Your Contribution Helps</h2>
    <p>
      Any amount you are able to give moves us closer to stability:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>$10–$50</strong> helps with hauling fees, cleaning supplies, and small fixes.</li>
      <li><strong>$100–$250</strong> helps cover portions of monthly tax payments or professional labor.</li>
      <li><strong>$500+</strong> makes a real dent in back taxes or a specific repair project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Donations go directly to me (David Lones) via PayPal, and will be used in this order of priority:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop the risk of losing the property to unpaid taxes.</li>
      <li>Make the home safe, clean, and functional again.</li>
      <li>Preserve what we can for my family rather than seeing it lost after everything we’ve put into it.</li>
