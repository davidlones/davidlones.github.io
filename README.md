# Echoes of a Lones Site

Within this small repository lie several portals of a static website. Nothing here runs on a server; each page stands alone.

- `index.html` – a black screen with a lone button labeled **random_chunk**. Clicking it summons five seconds of white noise, then plays three minutes from a random spot in `output.mp3`, followed by another burst of static.
- `services.html` – an under‑construction landing page advertising technology services. Each heading reveals more text when clicked. A small chat form posts messages to `http://dl.system42.one:8042/api`.
- `alt2.html` – an exported Obsidian document, filled with references to remote fonts and styles.
- `document.html` – a massive single line of HTML referencing external fonts.
- `news.txt` – a Byte Magazine‑style article announcing ChatGPT.
- `output.mp3` – the audio used by `index.html`.
- `LICENSE` – MIT.
